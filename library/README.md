# Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Dimension

## Library
The included Library is based on a Library that can be downloaded [here](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/339008). It describes the layout of the Raspberry Pi B+ family and can be used to create a shield for the Raspberry Pi.

It features the full layout of Raspberry Pi B/B+ as well as a slightly smaller layout of the Raspberry PI B/B+. The slightly one does not include the ethernet Jack or the USB Type-A ports.
